# Blinds
Blinds is an iOS library that allows you to created wrapping content DropDown menus. Ideal to be used with Json data to create FAQ's or diplay section-based documments.

- Uses two main arrays one for the header and anthor for the content
- Size, font size and width configurable

I'm still working on making this design a little more friendly.
